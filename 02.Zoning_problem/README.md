# Zoning Problem

The zoning problem deals with designating the appropriate locations for the various functions in the space program clubbed under particular zones. Two things are primarily important while assigning the zones the closeness requirements of the zones with respect to each other and the appropriateness of the zones w.r.t to the decisions taken by the architect regarding the desired performance criteria. 

The concept of multi-agent systems is used to solve the zoning problem.The system tries to achieve the global and local goals of the zonal configuration like controllable generation of a spatial system consisting of routes pertaining to a graph with closeness weights, spatial zones fitting into locations fulfilling their requirements and fitting their performance goals, and the compactness of the entire system into a space-efficient mass by devising the rules and behaviours of the agents in a quest for emergent optimal configuration such as a termite mound. Choosing a multi agent system over other techniques is done due to the transparency and adaptability of the method to search for valid options in the massive combinatorial search space along with didactic reasons.

# Aim
To assign Zones in a massing model which will achieve the maximum performance value and the necessary closeness requirements as specified by the stakeholder.
